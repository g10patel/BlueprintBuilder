# Blueprint Builder (CAD)

Blueprint Builder is a CAD (Computer Aided Design) program, writting in Java, that allows the user to create custom 2d blueprints which will be able to convert to
a 3d Model.

# Installation
JDK 15 and JavaFX were used for this program.

My choice of IDE: IntelliJ

Please refer to this guide for the environment of your choice for the installation of JavaFX

# Disclaimer
This is still a work in progress so not all of the buttons/functionality are working. For example the 3d component has yet to be started. I will be continually
adding to the project and optimizing daily so be on the lookout for updates.
